# **Machine Learning Track_Knowledge Officer Capstone Project**

## Amazon book review sentiment analysis Classification 

This project is part of Knowledge officer Machine learning (ML) 
Track. This project is the first project in  the track.

# Motivation

Classify articles into categories based on their contents. Various classifiers were tried - Naive Bayesian Classifier and support vectors machine.


## Installation

pip install numpy

pip install pandas

pip install pickle

pip install matplotlib

pip install scikit-learn

pip install seaborn

pip install nltk

pip install spacy

pip install contractions

pip install bs4

pip install string

pip install itertools

nltk.download('stopwords')

Installation
All libraries are avilable in Anaconda distribution of 
Python except the following library, you should install it:

Natural Language Toolkit - nltk library.
## Data

The dataset is avilable in knowledgeofficer website.

## File Descriptions

There are two folders. each for the used algorithms.

Each folder contains the data, the vectorized data, models, 
notebooks and the ReadME file on how to run the model.
## Summary

In this project, I used web articles dataset to classify the 
articles text. I used TF-IDF feature extraction algorithm and 
two different machine learning algorithms: 
Support Vector Machine ,Naive Bayes.





In this repository, you will find all process of my NLP study from the scratch

The order of the files are:
1) Data_cleaning_and_feature_extraction.ipynb
2) Amazon_Review_Data_Visulization.ipynb
3) Sentiment_Analysis_Amazon_Review.ipynb
4) Topic_Modeling_Amazon_Reviews.ipynb
5) Prediction_Model_Creation.ipynb

This order also represents the order of my studies. In order to understand the codes used in the study fully, given order needs to be followed. 

In the **NLP_Capstone_Project** report, you will see the steps and findings of all these studies in APA format. 
Report doesn't include every visuals that are available in the colab files. I only included only the relevant visuals in the report. However, there are still additional interesting visuals in these colab notebooks!

For checking innitial findings of EDA and data visulization, you can read Milestone report.
**Milestone report** includes:

    ⦿Problem statement: Why it’s a useful question to answer and details about the client (get this from your proposal)    
    
    ⦿Description of the dataset, how you obtained, cleaned, and wrangled it 
    
    ⦿initial findings from exploratory analysis (data story and inferential statistics)
        
        ‣Summary of findings
        
        ‣Visuals and statistics to support findings


Lastly, 'Project_Presentation' file was prepared for presenting main focuses of this project to technical and non-technical audiences. 

Have fun!
