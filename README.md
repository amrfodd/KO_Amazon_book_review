# **Machine Learning Track_Knowledge Officer Capstone Project**

## Amazon book review sentiment analysis Classification 

This project is part of Knowledge officer Machine learning (ML) 
Track. This project is the first project in  the track.

# Motivation

Classify articles into categories based on their contents. Various classifiers were tried - Naive Bayesian Classifier.

pip install numpy

pip install pandas

pip install pickle

Installation
All libraries are avilable in Anaconda distribution of 
Python except the following library, you should install it:

Natural Language Toolkit - nltk library.
## Data

The dataset is avilable on Kaggle.

## File Descriptions

There are two folders. each for the used algorithms.

Each folder contains the data, the vectorized data, 
notebooks and the ReadME file on how to run the model.

## Summary

In this project, I used Amazon book reviews dataset to classify the 
articles text. I used TF-IDF feature extraction algorithm and 
two different machine learning algorithms: 
Logistic regression and Naive Bayes with its variants.
